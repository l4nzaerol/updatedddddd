# Inventory Accuracy and Daily Output Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Inventory Management system to ensure accurate data display and fully functional daily output functionality.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Accurate Status Calculations
- **Enhanced Status Logic**: Updated the `statusFromLevels` function to provide more accurate status calculations based on stock levels
- **Safety Stock Integration**: Added safety stock consideration in status calculations for raw materials
- **Critical Stock Detection**: Added "Critical Stock" status when inventory falls below safety stock levels
- **Improved Status Hierarchy**:
  - Out of Stock (0 quantity)
  - Critical Stock (≤ safety stock)
  - Reorder now (≤ reorder point)
  - Overstock (above max level)
  - In Stock (normal levels)

### 2. Raw Materials Table Enhancements
- **Added Reorder Point Column**: New column showing reorder point for each material
- **Improved Data Display**: Better formatting and organization of inventory data
- **Enhanced Status Indicators**: More accurate status badges with proper color coding
- **Better Stock Information**: Clear display of current stock vs. reorder point

### 3. Daily Output Functionality
- **API Route Addition**: Added `/inventory/alkansya-daily-output/statistics` route for proper statistics
- **Enhanced Statistics Display**: Comprehensive statistics showing:
  - Total output
  - Average daily production
  - Last 7 days production
  - Production days count
- **Current Stock Display**: Real-time display of current Alkansya stock levels
- **Production Efficiency**: Calculation and display of production efficiency metrics

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- **Enhanced Daily Output Tab**: 
  - Professional card-based layout
  - Comprehensive statistics display
  - Current stock and efficiency metrics
  - Clear call-to-action buttons
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Improved spacing, colors, and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Cards and layouts that work on different screen sizes

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- **Linting Fixes**: Resolved all ESLint warnings and errors
- **Unused Code Cleanup**: Commented out unused utility functions
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Fixed useEffect cleanup functions
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling for API calls

## Technical Details

### Status Calculation Logic
```javascript
// For raw materials - use accurate reorder logic
if (category === 'raw') {
  if (onHand === 0) return { label: "Out of Stock", variant: "danger" };
  if (onHand <= safetyStock) return { label: "Critical Stock", variant: "danger" };
  if (onHand <= rop) return { label: "Reorder now", variant: "danger" };
  if (maxLevel && onHand > maxLevel) return { label: "Overstock", variant: "warning" };
  return { label: "In Stock", variant: "success" };
}
```

### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /inventory/alkansya-daily-output/statistics` - Get comprehensive production statistics
